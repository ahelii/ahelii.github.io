## About me
Hello! My name is *Aheli*. I am currently studying Paleontology at the <em>University of Alberta</em>. I love dinosaurs and am hoping to go to Antartica one day on expiditions to find fossils.

### Dinosaurs

This is my current favorite dinosaur:

This is ornithomimus. It is a very cool bipedal dinosaur that lived in the late creatceous time period. To find out more you can learn about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithomimus


Some dinosaurs that I also am a fan of include: 
- Hatzegopteryx
- Pterosaur
- Itchthyovenator
- Leaellynasaura


I can also name some dinosaurs per time period. Let us make a table and try! 

Time     | Triassic | Jurassic | Cretaceous |
         |----------|----------|------------|
aquatic  | Value 1  | Value 2  | Value 3  |
2-legged | Value A  | Value B  | Value C  |
